#+END_TIP
## 1. Let's create a page [[How to take dummy notes?]]. You can click it to go to that page, or you can `Shift+Click` to open it in the right sidebar! Now you should see both _Linked References_ and _Unlinked References_.
## 2. Let's reference some blocks on [[How to take dummy notes?]], you can `Shift+Click` any block reference to open it in the right sidebar too. Try making 
some changes on the right sidebar, those referenced blocks will be changed too!

## 3. I don't want to just reference the block title, how about embedding the whole block with it's children?
### {{{embed ((5f713e91-8a3c-4b04-a33a-c39482428e2d)) }}}
## 4. What if I want to embed the whole page? Here you go:
### {{{embed [[How to take dummy notes?]] }}}
